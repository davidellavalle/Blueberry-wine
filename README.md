## Data description

[Wine Quality dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) is public available for research in the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning repository created by Paulo Cortez (Univ. Minho), Antonio Cerdeira, Fernando Almeida, Telmo Matos and Jose Reis (CVRVV) in 2009. This repository has two datasets of red and white wine samples which consists of inputs includes objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). There are 1599 samples of red wine and 4898 samples of white wine in the data sets. Each wine sample (row) has the following characteristics (columns):

* Wine type - Red and White. 
* Fixed acidity - acids are major wine properties and contribute greatly to the wine’s taste. Usually, the total acidity is divided into two groups: the volatile acids and the nonvolatile or fixed acids. Among the fixed acids that can be found in wines are the following: tartaric, malic, citric, and succinic. This variable is expressed in g(tartaricacid)/dm3 in the data sets.
* Volatile acidity - the volatile acidity is basically the process of wine turning into vinegar. In the U.S, the legal limits of Volatile Acidity are 1.2 g/L for red table wine and 1.1 g/L for white table wine. In these data sets, the volatile acidity is expressed in g(aceticacid)/dm3.
* Citric acid - one of the fixed acids that in wines. It’s expressed in g/dm3 in the two data sets.
* Residual sugar - typically refers to the sugar remaining after fermentation stops, or is stopped. It’s expressed in g/dm3 in the red and white data.
* Chlorides - contributor to saltiness in wine. Here expressed in g(sodiumchloride)/dm3.
* Free sulfur dioxide - the part of the sulfur dioxide that is added to a wine and that is lost into it is said to be bound, while the active part is said to be free. The winemaker will always try to get the highest proportion of free sulfur to bind. This variable is expressed in mg/dm3 in the data.
* Total sulfur dioxide - the sum of the bound and the free sulfur dioxide (SO2). Here expressed in mg/dm3. There are legal limits for sulfur levels in wines: in the EU, red wines can only have 160mg/L, while white and rose wines can have about 210mg/L. Sweet wines are allowed to have 400mg/L. For the US, the legal limits are set at 350mg/L, and for Australia, this is 250mg/L.
Density
* pH - numeric scale to specify the acidity or basicity the wine. Solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic, while solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. With a pH of 7, pure water is neutral. Most wines have a pH between 2.9 and 3.9 and are therefore acidic.
* Sulphates - are to wine as gluten is to food. They are a regular part of winemaking around the world and are considered necessary. Here expressed in g(potassiumsulphate)/dm3.
* Alcohol - wine is an alcoholic beverage and its percentage of alcohol can vary from wine to wine. This variable is expressed in % vol.
* Quality - score between 0 and 10
